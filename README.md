# DexLot Test-Swap

This is a clone of the open-source Uniswap V2 interface, with added support for testnets on every network that DexLot supports.
Its purpose is to make it easier for token developers to test their tokens before launching on the mainnet.

You can use the test-swap page here: https://test-swap.dexlot.app 

To be more specific, our site supports the Ropsten testnet for the Ethereum network, and the Mumbai testnet for Polygon.
